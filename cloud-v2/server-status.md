# BZ5 Cloud — server status (Друг 2 → Друг 1 sync)

Last updated: 2026-07-04 (S1–S5 + email relay LIVE) · Author: Друг 2 (bz5-bridge, VPS) · Base spec: `spec-v1.3-FINAL.md`

Purpose: keep client (Друг 1) and server (Друг 2) synchronized on what the server
has actually built and **deployed to prod**, what's live to code against, and
what's still pending. Living doc — updated as stages land.

---

## 1. Stage status

| Stage | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **S1** hygiene | offsite backup (Scaleway+age, cron), `make test` isolated to a test DB | ✅ done |
| **S2** account core | email-OTP accounts, JWT+refresh, allowlist, auth audit, sweeper | ✅ **done + deployed** |
| **S4-prelude (C1)** | `client_uuid` column ×5 + `POST /v2/sync/uuid-mapping` | ✅ **done + deployed** |
| **S3** pairing | device-flow (user_code + device_code), revoke, legacy bind | ✅ **done + deployed** |
| **S4** full sync | `server_seq`/`updated_at`/`deleted_at`, pull, dual UNIQUE | ✅ **done + deployed** |
| **S4b** ingest v2 | dedup on `(vehicle_id, client_uuid)` for push v2; legacy partial | ✅ **done + deployed** |
| **S5** web cabinet | `/v2/account/*` reads + `/cabinet` read-only browser view | ✅ **done + deployed** |

Migrations live on prod: `0004` (auth), `0005` (client_uuid), `0006` (pairing),
`0007` (server_seq + trigger + dual UNIQUE + updated_at/deleted_at), `0008` (old
per-device UNIQUEs → partial `WHERE client_uuid IS NULL`). Data intact
(devices=2, trips=54, snapshots=1315; verified byte-identical across both
deploys). 110 server tests green.

**S4b note:** instead of dropping the old per-device UNIQUEs, `0008` makes them
partial (`WHERE client_uuid IS NULL`), complementary to `0007`'s
`(vehicle_id, client_uuid) WHERE client_uuid IS NOT NULL`. This closes the wipe
defect NOW (reused client_*_id + fresh uuid → new row) without breaking legacy
no-uuid pushes. A future revision can drop the empty legacy partials once no
client pushes without a uuid — gated on backfill confirmed from BOTH live devices
(server-status §5a B2 gate: +117 must run on both installs). `0007` adds the new
`(vehicle_id, client_uuid)` partial UNIQUE alongside the old ones.

## 2. Live endpoints (code against these now)

Error body is always `{"detail": {"error": {"code","message"}}}` (FastAPI wraps
one level). Success shapes below.

### Account auth (phone) — `/v2/auth/*`
- `POST /v2/auth/otp/request` `{email}` → `200 {"ok":true}` (always, when
  configured — anti-enumeration; only permitted addresses get a code).
  `429 rate_limited` (5/h per email, 20/h per IP), `503 auth_not_configured`.
- `POST /v2/auth/otp/verify` `{email, code}` →
  `200 {access_token, refresh_token, token_type:"bearer", expires_in:900}`.
  `401 invalid_code`, `403 not_allowed`, `503 auth_not_configured`.
- `POST /v2/auth/refresh` `{refresh_token}` → `200` new pair.
  `401 invalid_refresh`; `401 refresh_reused` (replay → **session revoked**,
  re-login).
- `POST /v2/auth/logout` (Bearer **access JWT**) → `200 {"ok":true}`.

**Token model:** access = HS256 **JWT, 15 min**, stateless — send as
`Authorization: Bearer` on `/v2` account calls. refresh = **opaque, single-use,
rotating**: every refresh returns a NEW refresh token; the old one is dead;
**persist the newest, never retry an old one** (replay revokes the whole
session). Store refresh in secure storage.

### Sync backfill (head unit) — `/v2/sync/uuid-mapping`
- `POST /v2/sync/uuid-mapping` (Bearer **device_token**) `{entity, items[]}` →
  `{received, matched, unmatched, already_set, conflicts}`.
- `entity ∈ trips|snapshots|sweeps|livelogs|canmonitor`; `items` =
  `[{client_id:int, client_uuid:"<lowercase uuid>"}]`; ≤1000/POST.
- Idempotent (replay → `already_set`), unmatched is fine, conflicts are
  first-write-wins (no overwrite). Full contract:
  `cloud-v2/c1-mapping-contract-review.md`. Also in served `CLIENT_API.md` §3.8.

### Sync pull (restore) — `/v2/sync/pull` — NEW (S4)
- `GET /v2/sync/pull?vehicle=<uuid>&since=<server_seq>&limit=<n>` (auth: device
  token bound to that vehicle **or** account JWT of the owner **or** admin) →
  `{items:[{entity,server_seq,client_uuid,deleted_at,data}], next_since, has_more}`.
- Ordered by a **single global `server_seq`** (total order, no ties). Full
  restore = pages from `since=0` until `has_more=false`. Covers **trips +
  snapshots** only (restore scope). Apply idempotently by `client_uuid` with an
  overlap window (D8, client half). `limit` 1–1000, default 500. Full contract:
  served `CLIENT_API.md` §3.9.

### Pairing (head unit ↔ account) — `/v2/pair/*`, `/v2/devices` — NEW (S3)
Device-flow, two secrets (D9): `device_code` (long, held by the head unit,
releases the token) + `user_code` (short, shown on screen, typed on the phone).
- `POST /v2/pair/start` (Bearer device_token for live device / no auth for fresh)
  → `{device_code, user_code, expires_in, interval}`.
- `POST /v2/pair/claim` (Bearer account JWT) `{user_code, vehicle_id?}` →
  `{"ok":true}`. `404 pairing_invalid`, `400 no_vehicle`.
- `POST /v2/pair/status` (no auth — device_code is the secret) `{device_code}` →
  `{status: pending|paired|expired, device_id?, client_token?, interval?}`.
  Fresh-device token is in `client_token`, released **exactly once**.
- `GET /v2/devices` (account JWT) → your devices. `POST /v2/devices/{id}/revoke`
  (account JWT). Full shapes in served `CLIENT_API.md` §1.2/§1.3.

### Account reads (cabinet + app) — `/v2/account/*` — NEW (S5)
Account-JWT, scoped to vehicles the account owns (unowned `vehicle` → `403`):
- `GET /v2/account/me` → `{user_id, email, role, vehicles:[{id, display_name,
  manufacturer, model, model_year, trip_count, snapshot_count, device_count}]}`.
- `GET /v2/account/trips?vehicle=&limit=&cursor=` → `PagedTrips` (id-desc cursor).
- `GET /v2/account/snapshots?vehicle=&limit=&cursor=` → `PagedSnapshots`.
Read-only web cabinet at **`/cabinet`** (email-OTP login, Overview/Devices/Trips/
Snapshots). Full contract: served `CLIENT_API.md` §1.4.

### Owner-side (not for the client) — `/v1/admin/allowlist`
`GET/POST/DELETE` (admin token). Owner manages who may sign in.

Unchanged: all v1 device auth, ingest, command, diag surfaces work exactly as
before. Device tokens are untouched (spec D5).

---

## 3. Config / operational state

- `OWNER_EMAIL` set on prod (Alex's address). First `otp/verify` from it claims
  the seed owner (bootstrap). **Bootstrap not yet performed** — seed
  `users.email` is still NULL until that first verify.
- `JWT_SECRET` set (rotating it = global logout).
- ✅ **Email delivery is LIVE.** `EMAIL_BACKEND=resend`, from
  `noreply@carbridge.neardo.work` (domain verified in Resend: DKIM + SPF/MX on the
  `send.` subdomain, DMARC-aligned via DKIM). Real OTP emails now reach any
  allowlisted address — C2 end-to-end login testing is unblocked. Sending is a
  send-only API key; a relay hiccup returns `200` (not `500`) and is logged, so it
  never leaks enumeration.
- Retention (auto): otp_codes 1d, auth_events 365d, sessions 60d idle.

---

## 4. Readiness per client stage

- **C1 (Drift 13→14 + mapping)** — ✅ **server ready & live.** `client_uuid`
  columns + `/v2/sync/uuid-mapping` deployed; the 404-before-deploy window is
  effectively gone. Contract (Q1–Q8) confirmed in `c1-mapping-contract-review.md`.
  You can ship +117 on Alex's go.
- **C2 (Auth UI, phone)** — ✅ **server ready & relay LIVE.** Endpoints in §2;
  real OTP emails now delivered (Resend, §3). End-to-end login testing is fully
  unblocked for any allowlisted address.
- **C3 (Pairing UI)** — ✅ **server ready & live (S3).** Wire `pair/start` (with
  device_token for the current install, without for a fresh one), show
  `user_code`+QR, poll `pair/status` at `interval`; "My devices" via
  `GET /v2/devices` + revoke. Scenario (b) delivers the new token once — persist
  it immediately.
- **C4 (Push v2)** — ✅ **server ready & live (S4b).** Send an optional
  `client_uuid` (lowercase UUIDv7) on each ingested row of the 5 synced types;
  the server then dedups on `(vehicle_id, client_uuid)`. Omit it → unchanged
  legacy per-device dedup. **Ordering:** finish the C1 `uuid-mapping` backfill and
  set `uuid_mapping_pushed` BEFORE enabling v2 push, else a push-v2 row whose
  server pair still has `client_uuid=NULL` collides on the old per-device key.
  Reused `client_*_id` + fresh uuid now inserts as a new row (wipe defect closed).
  Contract in served `CLIENT_API.md` §3.
- **C5 (Restore)** — ✅ **server ready & live (S4).** `GET /v2/sync/pull` (§2)
  delivers `server_seq`-ordered pages of trips+snapshots with `client_uuid`.
  Wire the restore master to pull from `since=0`, apply idempotently by
  `client_uuid`, keep a cursor with overlap (D8).
- **C6 (Graceful 401)** — server-independent; the token-revoke behavior it
  targets already exists.

---

## 5. Notes / gotchas for the client

- **Two separate credentials.** Device token (v1, head-unit ingest/command) is
  unchanged and permanent. Account access/refresh (v2, phone) is a new, separate
  layer. Don't cross them: device traffic stays on the device token.
- **Bootstrap/allowlist.** First account login must be `OWNER_EMAIL`. After that
  only allowlisted addresses receive codes (owner adds them). A non-allowlisted
  address silently gets no code (200, no email) and `403 not_allowed` if it
  reaches verify.
- **uuid-mapping is one-time & device-scoped.** Send all local rows; the server
  matches only this device's rows by `(device_id, client_id)`. Set your
  `uuid_mapping_pushed` flag only after all 5 entities return 2xx. Replays are
  safe.
- **The wipe defect isn't closed by C1 alone** (per spec §2.5). The SERVER half
  is now live (S4b: `(vehicle_id, client_uuid)` dedup active). It fully closes
  once the CLIENT ships C4 (sending `client_uuid` on push, after the C1 backfill
  completes). Until +C4 is on both installs, keep the "don't wipe Drift on the
  head unit" operational rule.

---

## 5a. Client-side deviations (noted from +117 — no server impact)

Recorded so paper matches code:
- **mapping-push runs at the END of `syncOnce`** (after ingest pushes), not
  before (spec §1.4 said before). Reason: a fresh device identity would push
  mapping "into the void" before data is loaded. Server is idempotent → order is
  irrelevant to the contract. ✓
- **Per-entity watermarks** instead of a single one-shot flag → the client can
  delta-remap rows created during the C1→C4 window. Server handles this natively
  (`matched` for the new rows, `already_set` for replays). The spec's "set flag
  after all 5 entities" is a special case. ✓
- **e2e confirmation pending:** after the first real sync, +117 will report
  actual `matched/unmatched/conflicts` back — that closes C1 verification.
- **B2 gate (reminder, server-side):** prod has `devices=2`. The old per-device
  UNIQUEs are dropped (full S4) only after mapping has arrived from **both** live
  installs — i.e. +117 must run on both, not just the head unit. This is the
  §3.5 NULL-remainder check, now with the operational note that it's per-device.

## 6. What Друг 2 does next (server)

S4, S4b, S5 all deployed; **email relay is now LIVE** (Resend from
`noreply@carbridge.neardo.work`). The cloud-v2 server side (S1–S5 + relay) is
**complete**. Only remaining server item: a future tiny revision to drop the
now-empty legacy partial indexes once no client pushes without a `client_uuid`
(B2 gate: backfill confirmed on both devices). The pull payload includes
`client_uuid`, so the restore path (§1.5 of the C1 plan) can adopt server uuids
instead of regenerating. The ball is now on the client (C4 push v2, C5 restore —
both server-ready) and C2 auth UI (relay unblocks end-to-end).
